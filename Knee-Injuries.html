          Your knee is the largest joint in your body. As well as providing support for your body weight, it lets your
          legs bend and straighten. A healthy knee
          allows you to walk, climb stairs and participate in sports and hobbies. A knee injury can stop you doing
          things you need to as well as things you
          enjoy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Knee injuries are common and can affect people of all ages. Many types of knee injuries can be managed with
          conservative measures, such as rest and
          physiotherapy. Some knee injuries need surgery to repair damaged tissues and achieve the best possible
          long-term outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our orthopaedic surgeons are experts at diagnosing and managing knee injuries. We offer world-class care, with
          a focus on finding the cause of
          your symptoms and tailoring personalised treatment plans.

            <h3>Knee injury types
            </h3>
                <p>
                Knee injuries include dislocations, fractures, and soft tissue tears or
                sprains. Often, an injury will cause damage to more than one knee structure.</p>
                <p>Common knee injury types include:

              <h4>
                Knee fractures
              </h4>
              <p>
                Knee fractures are usually caused by significant trauma, such as a motor
                vehicle accident or fall from a height. The patella (kneecap) is the most
                commonly broken bone in the knee. The ends of the shin bone and thigh bone
                within the knee joint can also be fractured.

                <h4>
                  Ligament injuries
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Your knee has four major supporting ligaments, any of which can be strained
                  or torn. These ligaments are:
                </p>
                <h6 class="bulletpoints">The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)</h6> 
                  <p class="bulletpoints">This is often injured in sports
                  that involve pivoting, sudden direction changes or cutting movements, such
                  as football, soccer, and netball. About half of all ACL injuries will also
                  involve damage to other knee structures, such as cartilage and other
                  ligaments.
                  </p>
                <h6 class="bulletpoints">The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL)</h6> 
                <p class="bulletpoints">PCL injuries are less common.
                They are usually caused by a blow to the front of a bent knee. This could
                result from a motor vehicle accident or sporting contact.
                </p>
                <h6 class="bulletpoints">The medial collateral ligament (MCL)</h6> 
                <p class="bulletpoints">The MCL runs down the inside edge
                of the knee. It can be damaged by forces that push the knee too far
                sideways, such as a blow to the outside of the knee or an awkward landing
                while playing sport.
                </p>
                <h6 class="bulletpoints">The lateral collateral ligament (LCL)</h6> 
                <p class="bulletpoints">This ligament runs down the outside edge of the knee. It may also be damaged by a force that pushes the
                knee too far sideways. LCL tears are less common than other ligament
                injuries.
                </p>
              <h4>
                Meniscal injuries
              </h4>
              <p>
                The menisci (or meniscus for one) are two wedge-shaped pieces of
                specialised cartilage that sit in the knee joint. They absorb shock,
                transmit weight between the knee bones, and help to stabilise the knee
                joint.
              </p>
              <p>
                Meniscal tears are common knee injuries. They usually result from a
                forceful twist or rotation of the knee while you’re taking weight through
                it. Meniscal injuries are common in sports that involve pivoting, cutting
                and tackling. The menisci also tend to get weaker with age. If you’re older
                or have arthritis, you could injure meniscus by a simple movement such as
                twisting in the garden.
              </p>
              <h4>
                Tendon injuries
              </h4>
              <p>
                Your knee joint has several tendons around it. These attach muscles to
                bones to make the joint move. The patellar, quadriceps and hamstring
                tendons can be stretched or torn.
              </p>
              <p>
                Knee tendon injuries are common in running and jumping sports. They can
                also be caused by a fall or awkward landing.
              </p>
              <p>
                If a tendon gets irritated it can lead to inflammation, which is known as
                tendonitis. This is most common in people who do repetitive activities,
                such as long-distance running, kneeling on the knee for work, and sports
                that involve a lot of jumping.
              </p>
              <h4>
                Knee dislocation
              </h4>
              <p>
                A dislocation happens when the knee bones move out of place. This most
                commonly happens to the patella. Your patella normally sits in a groove at
                the front of the knee but can move across sideways. Some people are born
                with a bone structure that makes this more likely. Patella dislocations can
                also be caused by sporting injuries and other accidents.
              </p>
              <p>
                The shin and thigh bones can also be pushed out of alignment, usually by
                significant trauma such as a fall or serious accident.

              <h3>Knee injury symptoms</h3>
              <p>
                Swelling and pain are the most common symptoms of a knee injury. Depending on which structures are
                damaged, a knee injury can also causeissues such as catching, clicking or locking and instability – the feeling that your knee might give way.
              </p>
              <hr>
              <h3>
                Knee injury diagnosis
              </h3>
              <p>
                To get to the bottom of your knee problem, your health professional will do
                different things depending on the injury type and severity. For example, if
                your knee is fractured or dislocated, you need urgent medical assessment.
                Your doctor will probably arrange imaging tests such as an X-ray, CT scan
                or MRI to see what’s happening in your knee.
              </p>
              <p>
                They will also look for signs of damage to other tissues, such as nerves or
                blood vessels, which could be serious if not discovered and treated. An
                orthopaedic specialist will often be consulted to help make the diagnosis
                and decide on the best course of action.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the injury is less severe or you’ve had symptoms for a while, your
                doctor will probably see you in their rooms. They will ask questions like
                how the injury happened and how it affects your daily life. They will look
                at your knee, checking for things like tenderness, swelling, clicking, and
                pain or limited movement. They might move your knee different ways to check
                whether ligaments are loose or torn.
              </p>
              <p>
                Your doctor might also refer you for imaging to see what’s happening in
                your knee, along with blood tests. These can help provide a more complete
                picture of your knee injury. Your doctor might also refer you to an
                orthopaedic specialist for a review and opinion.
              </p>
              <hr>
              <h3>
                How are knee injuries treated?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Because knee injuries can affect different structures and vary in severity,
                they are managed in different ways. For example, a serious injury such as a
                fracture, dislocation or ligament rupture needs specialised medical care
                and possible surgery. Treatment for knee tendonitis could involve
                medications, rest from aggravating activities and physiotherapy.

                Surgery for knee injuries
              </h4>
              <p>
                Some knee injuries need surgery to repair or replace damaged tissues and
                help ensure you have the best chance of making a good recovery. Your
                specialist might also recommend surgery if other treatment options haven’t
                managed your symptoms effectively.
              </p>
              <p>
                Knee surgery can often be performed arthroscopically (through keyholes
                using a special camera and instruments). Some procedures, such as a total
                knee replacement or fracture repair, will need a larger cut.
                Your orthopaedic surgeon can discuss your options with you and provide
                guidance about the best course of action in your situation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Examples of surgeries used to manage knee injuries include:

                          Repairs</h3>Knee fractures may be managed by repairing damaged bones with
                          pins, plates or screws. ACL tears are also often repaired surgically. This
                          is known as an ACL reconstruction.

                          Joint replacement</h3>This involves replacing the knee joint with an
                          artificial one. It is most commonly used to manage knee arthritis. If only one section of your knee is damaged, you
                          might have what’s known as a unicompartmental (or partial) knee
                          replacement.

              <h3>
                How long does it take to recover from a knee injury?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Recovery time can vary significantly depending on injury type and severity,
                as well as factors like your age and lifestyle. A mild ligament strain
                might be better in six to 12 weeks, whereas it could take a year or more to
                recover from a serious knee fracture.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many people will need physiotherapy and rehabilitation after a knee injury
                or surgery to restore movement, function and the ability to do things like
                drive, work and participate in sports or hobbies.
              </p>
              <p>
                Your orthopaedic surgeon can give you individual advice about how long it
                might take you to recover from your knee injury.<br><br>
